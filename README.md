New Barbie Introduced to interest Women in the <a href="http://www.yaleschoolpa.com/about/curriculum/steam/">STEM Areas</a>

Barbie aims to inspire women and instruct real-world programming abilities

The new Barbie intends to encourage girls' interest in areas of science, engineering, technology and mathematics, in which only 24 percent of jobs are held by women, as stated by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Mattel, the company that produces Barbie, composed in a release this doll will"shine a light in an underrepresented career area for ladies."

Let us inspire another generation to view themselves in professions underrepresented by women. By encouraging more women to research STEM using Robotics Engineer #Barbie, we show them they could be anything.

The STEM Barbie not just lets women envision themselves as a robotics engineer, but it teaches them the skills they will want to become one.

Contained in the launch are just six free Barbie-inspired coding matches, which the Mattel <a href="http://www.anobii.com/groups/01920ef08181baf2ae">company</a> made in partnership with Tynker, the instructional computer system.

"By playing Robotics Engineer Barbie offline and on, we're giving women a brand new platform for drama within their imaginary world and teaching them important skills to their actual world," explained Lisa McKnight, general manager and senior vice president of Barbie.

The programming games are thought to help build problem-solving abilities while teaching coding principles.

"It is essential that all young students have a chance to learn more about the possibilities out there in STEM areas, and Tynker's Barbie programming expertise is a valuable tool to introduce children of all ages to those theories while building their communicating abilities," said Krishna Vedati, co-founder and CEO of Tynker.

But, Barbie isn't any stranger at the STEM areas. Since the 1950s, the iconic doll was observed in roles of an astronaut, scientist, <a href="http://girlsgogogames.biz/">video game</a> programmer and computer programmer.
